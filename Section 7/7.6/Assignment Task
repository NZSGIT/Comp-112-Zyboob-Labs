(1) Create three files to submit:

ItemToPurchase.h - Struct definition and related function declarations
ItemToPurchase.c - Related function definitions

PrintItemCost()

Ex. of PrintItemCost() output:

(2) In main(), prompt the user for two items and create two objects of the ItemToPurchase struct. Before prompting for the second item, enter the following code to allow the user to input a new string. c is declared as a char. (2 pts)

c = getchar();
while(c != '\n' && c != EOF) {
   c = getchar();
}

Item 2
